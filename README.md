# Randomness in Team Ball Sports
 We created a match score dataset by scraping Wikipedia pages  using Python for the following team ball sports. We quantified average randomness factor values for each sport, resulting in a  dataset containing 12 rows (one per sport) and 14 columns (one per factor)

# Recent codebase update: 
- The file underdog_achievement_analysis.ipynb can now plot upper triangular matrices representing the differences in UAS values between pairs of sports and a graph depicting the evolution of UAS for each sport over time.
- The folder compress_data_reduced contains data from 1970 onward, excluding earlier years to avoid bias in the results, as earlier editions may exhibit different patterns.
- Minor updates to pca_correlation_analysis.ipynb and rank_difference_analysis.ipynb to align with the focus on data from 1970 onward.
